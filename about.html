			<h2 id="about">About</h2>
			<p>Hello! My name is Newt Powers, I use she/they pronouns, and I'm an embedded software engineer, FPGA engineer, and web developer. I'm originally from Los Angeles, and I was inspired to pursue engineering because of my involvement building trebuchets, launching rockets, and modeling bridges in high school. My goal in life is to pursue engineering in service of humanity, and I have followed this goal by writing tests for radars to defend our allies overseas with RTX, designed and built bridges in the Kingdom of Eswatini, Africa to provide rural communities access to healthcare, education, and markets, and programmed computer engineering methods for acceleromters, improving the next generation of aeronautic technology with NASA. Please get in contact with me if you are interested in my work, wish to collaborate, or would like to receive my services.</p>

		<!--for now, the professional experience should look kinda like a website: think angelina's, make max 2 sentences, include organizations, education; decide whether want to separate out volunteer, research, professional, etc-->
		<!--about section should specify basic background, title (embedded SWE, FPGA engineer, web developer), name, pronouns, from LA, inspiration to why STEM, overview of cornell like linkedin but the one sentence per important activity, perhaps engineering in service of humanity as a theme-->
		<!--skills should just be listed 2 columns maybe with rounded boxes including logos specifically, all used OR all good at-->
		<!--projects should include embedded accelerometer game, soil moisture sensor, perhaps this website with desciption and link to project outline. FIGURE OUT FORMATTING!!-->
		<!--CSS styling for navbar-->
