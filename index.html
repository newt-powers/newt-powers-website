<!-- tables and lists anywhere? flex and grid css formatting was wrong. added in nav tag. learned about style guide, added responsive layout for page, -->
<!--next step with w3 tutorials is to add a basic contact form, then do CSS tutorial with bootstrap, then do javascript tutorial if needed for web dev-->
